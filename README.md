This repository includes two parts: Bad Calculator and Bounce Pong

Bad Calculator
Essentially a calculator that will perform calculations, except it has odd behavior that makes it completely useless as an actual calculator. This is not intended to be used seriously.

Bounce Pong
This is a variation of Pong where the ball will bounce against the bottom of the screen. There is additionally a barrier in the center which the ball must clear in order to make it to the other side, making it much more similar to actual Ping-Pong.
